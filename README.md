This project is a demonstration of how to implement a U-Net neural network for image segmentation using TensorFlow. U-Net is a popular architecture for image segmentation tasks, especially in the field of medical imaging.

The project starts with installing the necessary dependencies, including TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets, which provide access to pre-processed data sets. In this case, the "Oxford-IIIT Pet" dataset is used, which contains images of cats and dogs with segmentation masks.

The dataset is then loaded and pre-processed with a custom load_image method that resizes the images and masks, converts the images to floats, and subtracts 1 from the mask values to convert them to integers starting at 0 .

After processing the data set, the images are visualized with Matplotlib. The first five images and their corresponding masks are displayed.

Then the U-Net model is defined using Keras. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, which are connected by hop connections that preserve spatial information. The encoder reduces the spatial dimensions of the input images while increasing the number of channels, and the decoder reverses this process to produce the final segmentation mask.

The U-Net model is compiled with an Adam optimizer, a sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and a precision metric. The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset for 20 epochs, and an early halt is applied to prevent overfitting.

Finally, the trained model is used to make predictions on the test dataset, and the input images, truth masks, and predicted masks are visualized using Matplotlib.

The code is commented throughout to explain the different implementation steps. Overall, this project provides a simple example of how to use a U-Net model for image segmentation using TensorFlow.
